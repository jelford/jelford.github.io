            <p><span class="codeword">spool</span> a JavaScript component and accompanying UserScript to let your users speed-read web-pages. The quickest way to try it out is to click on the description below.</p>

        <div class="separator" />

        <div id="trialarea">
            <p>
                <span class="codeword">spool</span>, inspired by <a href="http://www.spritzinc.com">Spritz</a> displays 
                text on the screen a single word at a time. The idea is that by aligning the words to the optimal 
                position for a reader's eye, they can recognise the word without having to re-adjust (a movement called
                a &quot;sacade.&quot; There's a lot of reasearch available on the subject of the eye's &quot;optimal landing
                position,&quot; but you can think of it as simply being the place in a word where the eye should
                rest in order to read it quickly.
            </p>
            <p>
                To control <span class="codeword">spool</span>, you can just hover the mouse over the text, and you'll
                see some controls appear. You can adjust the speed at which words are presented (the &quot;wpm&quot;
                option), and activate &quot;continuous spool&quot; to have <span class="codeword">spool</span> automatically
                move to the next paragraph after the last one finishes. Just hit &#x25A0; to stop <span class="codeword">spool</span>,
                and click-and-drag the word to the left to rewind (or, to the right to go forward).
