        <div class="post-excerpt"><p>Signals are an essential part of process life-cycle on linux, but 
working with them is ... fraught - probably because it's not 
obvious that special care is needed. In this post, we'll look at what a
signal <em>is</em> and just one of the challenging aspects: restrictions on signal handlers.</p>

        Hey there friend! Don't mind me, I'm just trying to get some idea of whether anyone reads this stuff. 
        Goatcounter (here: https://www.goatcounter.com/) tries to give that, and claims to do so without
        tracking. I hope that's acceptable to you.
