                ðŸš§ Hey there! You seem to have stumbled on a draft post! You're welcome to have a look around,
                but I'm still working on it, so it's likely that things are going to be rough around the
                edges. That's okay with me if it's okay with you.

        <p>Signals are an essential part of process lifecycle on linux, but 
working with them is often poorly understood - probably because it's not 
obvious that special care is needed. In this third post of the series, we'll
look at a final aspect of what makes signals difficult to work with correctly:
signal coalescence.</p>

        Hey there friend! Don't mind me, I'm just trying to get some idea of whether anyone reads this stuff. 
        Goatcounter (here: https://www.goatcounter.com/) tries to give that, and claims to do so without
        tracking. I hope that's acceptable to you.
