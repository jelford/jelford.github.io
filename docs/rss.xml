            <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post, we&#x27;ll take a look at linux signal handling in &lt;code&gt;rust&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. Signals are
an essential part of process lifecycle on linux, but working with them is often
poorly understood - probably because it&#x27;s not obvious that special care is needed.
By the end, we&#x27;ll get to an idiomatic way to receive signal information in
application code.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;How long should we expect themes and technologies in software engineering to last?
In this post, we&#x27;ll look at how long individual projects &amp;quot;last&amp;quot; based on data from GitHub
and try to draw conclusions around what that means for choosing foundational software.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
