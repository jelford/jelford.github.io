<h2 id="building-a-better-blog-organising-output">Building a better blog: organising output</h2>
<p>In the last entry, I walked through using a simple make-file to generate the HTML for a simple blog - it will convert a collection of markdown files into HTML snippets, then concatenate them into a single &quot;blog&quot; page.</p>
<p>In this entry, we'll build on that by managing multiple entries more in a nicer way:</p>
<ul>
<li>we'll make it put them into some sort of order (based on when they were written)</li>
<li>we'll style the resulting page to make it easier to see where one entry stops and the next one starts</li>
</ul>
